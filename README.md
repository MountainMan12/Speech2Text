# Speech2Text

Python Library to convert a speech text to a written text

This library exploits the dictionary functions to map the key and values to the spoken text.
For example, "two dollars" should be converted to $2. Abbreviations spoken as "C M" or "Triple A" should be written as "CM" and "AAA" respectively.

This Program was built using Python 3.7.4 64-bit

## INSTALLATION: 
```
Python 3+ : py -3 setup.py install
```

## HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
```
#SCRIPT 
import SpeechProcessing as SP

SP.sp()

#OUTPUT

I am ten years old. I want to become a C M of my state. I only have ten rupees
You entered:
I am ten years old. I want to become a C M of my state. I only have ten rupees
