# Speech2Text
Python Library to convert a speech text to a written text

This library exploits the dictionary functions to map the key and values to the spoken text.
For example, "two dollars" should be converted to $2. Abbreviations spoken as "C M" or "Triple A" should be written as "CM" and "AAA" respectively.

This Program was built using Python 3.7.4 64-bit
